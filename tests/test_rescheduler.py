# When no filter is provided, nothing should happen
# When no rules are passed in, all selected tasks should be rescheduled to the current day
# When rules are passed in, tasks should be rescheduled according to the rules using smart rescheduling, respecting max weight
# When rules are passed in and a max weight is set for each day, tasks are rescheduled according to the rules using smart rescheduling, respecting the daily max weight
# When dry run is enabled, no tasks should be updated
# When time zone is specified, tasks should be rescheduled properly according to that time zone
